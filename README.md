# Map Application/Points of Interest Finder
### Status: Work in Progress

This is the project I am currently working on in my spare time. It is an application that lets users discover nearby points of interest while going to their original destination. 
Users can create profiles that will be able to filter the types of places the application provides.

The program is written in Java using Android Studio. You can find some video demonstrations below.

# Installation
To try this application, download [**map-app.apk**](map-app.apk) in this repo, and transfer it to your device's storage. Then open up the .apk file inside your device to install. Make sure to give the application relevant permissions for it to run properly.

# Location Permission
Since this is an map application, your location is required for the application to function properly.
